		<p>Above all powers
			Above all kings
			Above all nature
			And all created things
			Above all wisdom
			And all the ways of man
			You were here
			Before the world began

		<p>Above all kingdoms
			Above all thrones
			Above all wonders
			The world has ever known
			Above all wealth
			And treasures of the earth
			There's no way to measure
			What You're worth
